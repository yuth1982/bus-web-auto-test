Feature: Notify about and collect past-due balances

  As a Mozy sales or finance representative
  I want to provide ample notification when a customer is past-due
  so that customers have as much opportunity as possible to make their account current before Mozy disables and eventually removes their service.

  Background:
    Given I log in bus admin console as administrator
