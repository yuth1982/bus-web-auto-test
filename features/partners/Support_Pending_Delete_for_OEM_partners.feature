    When I navigate to user login page with partner ID oem.partners.com
    And I log in bus admin console with user name @new_users[0].email and password reset password

    When I navigate to bus admin console login page
    And I log in bus admin console with user name @subpartner.admin_email_address and password reset password

    Then no report is scheduled for this partner

#    When I wait for 86460 seconds
#    And I search emails by keywords:
