    Scenario: [Bundled] Sort Columns

      When I add a new Reseller partner:
        | period | reseller type | reseller quota | server plan | net terms | company name                   |
        | 12     | Silver        | 100            | yes         | yes       | [Bundled] Sort User Group List |
      Then New partner should be created
      And I get the partner_id
      And I enable stash for the partner with default stash storage
      And I act as newly created partner

      And I add a new Bundled user group:
        | name         | storage_type |
        | User Group A | Shared       |
      Then User Group A user group should be created

      When I add a new Bundled user group:
        | name         | storage_type | assigned_quota | enable_stash |
        | User Group B | Assigned     | 10             | yes          |
      Then User Group B user group should be created

      And I add a new Bundled user group:
        | name         | storage_type | limited_quota | enable_stash |
        | User Group C | Limited      | 10            | yes          |
      Then User Group C user group should be created


      And I add new user(s):
        | name       | user_group           | storage_type | storage_limit | devices |
        | TC.20932-1 | (default user group) | Desktop      | 10            | 3       |
      Then 1 new user should be created
      And I search user by:
        | keywords   |
        | @user_name |
      And I view user details by newly created user email
      And I update the user password to default password
      And I add machines for the user and update its used quota
        | user_email  | machine_name | machine_type | partner_name  | used_quota |
        | @user_email | Machine1     | Desktop      | @partner_name | 1 GB       |
        | @user_email | Machine2     | Desktop      | @partner_name | 1 GB       |
        | @user_email | Machine3     | Desktop      | @partner_name | 1 GB       |
      Then I close user details section


      And I add new user(s):

        | TC.20932-2 | User Group B | Desktop      | 10            | 2       |
      Then 1 new user should be created

        | keywords   |
        | @user_name |
      And I view user details by newly created user email
      And I update the user password to default password
      And I add machines for the user and update its used quota
        | user_email  | machine_name | machine_type | partner_name  | used_quota |
        | @user_email | Machine1     | Desktop      | @partner_name | 1 GB       |
        | @user_email | Machine1     | Desktop      | @partner_name | 1 GB       |
      Then I close user details section

      And I add new user(s):
        | name       | user_group   | storage_type | storage_limit | devices |
        | TC.20932-3 | User Group C | Desktop      | 10            | 2       |
      Then 1 new user should be created

        | @user_email | Machine1     | Desktop      | @partner_name | 5 GB       |
      Then I close user details section

      When I navigate to User Group List section from bus admin console page

      Then Column Group Name sorts in ascending order

    And I add new user(s):
      | user_group   | name       | storage_type | storage_limit | devices |
      | User Group C | TC.20933-8 | Server       | 10            | 1       |
    Then 1 new user should be created
    And I search user by:
      | keywords   |
      | @user_name |
    And I view user details by newly created user email
    And I update the user password to default password
    And I add machines for the user and update its used quota
      | user_email  | machine_name | machine_type | partner_name  | used_quota |
      | @user_email | Machine1     | Server       | @partner_name | 4 GB       |
    Then I close user details section


    When I navigate to User Group List section from bus admin console page

    Then Column Group Name sorts in ascending order
    And Itemized user groups table should be:
