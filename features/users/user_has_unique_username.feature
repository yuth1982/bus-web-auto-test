  - suspended user's usernames cannot be used in account creation or added to an exhisting user
  - deleted user's usernames can be used in account creation or added to an exhisting user
  - Newly entered emails (usernames) must be unique across MozyHome, MozyPro, MozyEnterprise, MozyEnterpriseOld, and MozyCorp
  - When I update the email address, I see a error if there is a conflict within the partner or Mozy products
  - Don't cause failures when updating other fields (for example, display name) for existing users with non-unique usernames
  - Don't cause failures when updating users in other products (for example, MozyOEM)
