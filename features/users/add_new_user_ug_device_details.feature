Feature: Add new user, user group device details

  As an admin,
  when I provision a user,
  I can see how many devices are available to assign to a user after I select the User Group
  so that I can make a decision if I need to purchase more or not.

  Success Criteria:
  I can see how many desktop devices are available
  I can see how many server devices are available
  If MP direct and no UGs available (only 1 UG), the available devices are automatically shown

  Background:
    Given I log in bus admin console as administrator
