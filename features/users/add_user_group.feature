Feature: Add a new user group

  Background:
    Given I log in bus admin console as administrator

  @TC.849 @bus2.4 @tasks_p2 @ROR_smoke
  Scenario: 849 Add a new user group
    When I add a new OEM partner:
      | Company Name | Root role         | Security | Company Type     |
      | test_for_849 | OEM Partner Admin | HIPAA    | Service Provider |
    Then New partner should be created
    When I act as newly created subpartner account
    And I navigate to Purchase Resources section from bus admin console page
    And I save current purchased resources
    And I purchase resources:
      | desktop license | desktop quota | server license | server quota |
      | 2               | 20            | 2              | 20           |
    Then Resources should be purchased
    And I add a new user group for an itemized partner:
      | name                | server_assigned_quota | desktop_assigned_quota |
      | 849_user_group_test | 3                     | 3                      |
    Then Itemized partner user group 849_user_group_test should be created
    Then I stop masquerading from subpartner
    And I search and delete partner account by newly created subpartner company name

  @TC.848 @bus2.4 @tasks_p2
  Scenario: 848 Delete a user group
    When I add a new MozyEnterprise partner:
      | period | users | server plan | root role  |
      | 12     | 10    | 100 GB      | FedID role |
    Then New partner should be created
    And I act as newly created partner
    When I add a new Itemized user group:
      | name         | desktop_storage_type | desktop_devices | server_storage_type |
      | TC.848_group | Shared               | 1               | Shared              |
    Then Itemized user group should be created
    Then I navigate to User Group List section from bus admin console page
    And I view user group details by clicking group name: TC.848_group
    And I delete the user group
    And Itemized user groups table should be:
      | Group Name           | Sync | Desktop Storage Type | Desktop Type Value | Desktop Storage Used | Desktop Devices Used | Desktop Devices Total | Server Storage Type | Server Type Value | Server Storage Used | Server Devices Used | Server Devices Total |
      | (default user group) | true  | Shared               |                    | 0                    | 0                    | 10                    | Shared              |                   | 0                   | 0                   | 200                  |
    When I stop masquerading
    Then I search and delete partner account by newly created partner company name
