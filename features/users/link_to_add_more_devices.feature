Feature: Link to More Devices

  As an admin (without UG enabled),
  I want a path to purchase more devices (previously known as keys) if I'm running out,
  So that I have a easy way to manage my resource needs.

  Success Criteria:
  - Next to the available desktop and server devices the admin will have a link for "add More"
  - "add more" will redirect the admin to change plan page where they can add more devices to the account

  Background:
    Given I log in bus admin console as administrator
