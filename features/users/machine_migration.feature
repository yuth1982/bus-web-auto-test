#If you want to run these testcases in other environment other than QA5, You need to prepare these data
#To do: I will add a new feature to prepare these data automately
#(1). Add some partner with the following partner name and admin if not exist
# | partner name                      | admin                                    | usage                               |
# | Machine Migration Automation      | machine_migration_auto@auto.com          | general                             |
# | Machine Migration Add Delete Test | machine_migration_add_delete@auto.com    | add and delete user machine mapping |
# | Fed ID Partner                    | leongh+system@mozy.com                   | 10000 user machine mappings         |
# | Machine Migration for TC16273     | machine_migraion_tc16273@auto.com        | 0 user machine mappings             |
# | Freecom                           | robert.bartelds-at-freecom.com@mozy.test | a partner which has subpartner      |
# | Machine Migration for TC17936     | machine_migraion_tc17936@auto.com        | 2 users have the same machine       |
#(2). Bifrostcli needed for the "Machine Migration Add Delete Test"
#a. Download mozybfstcli from git repo and run 'python setup.py install' to install it
#b. Change /etc/mozybfst.yml according to "Machine Migration Add Delete Test", in QA5, 1 example is like:
#    secret: 5NDOVgE2OpdpZc5IPBEA8ZuQ6t2Ch7094MGoHg8nElxK6geBlpCFSSRxAt028Qa5
#    group_id: 129736

Feature: Machine migration (This is only for QA5 environment, This file will be replaced by machine_mapping.feature)

  As an admin
  I want to migrate machines from current owners to new owners
  So that I can proceed my work to migrate users between mozy and ad authentication

  Background:
    Given I log in bus admin console as administrator

  @TC.16266 @regression @smoke @bus @2.5 @machine_migration
  Scenario: 16266 Export the machine-user mapping csv file
    When I add a new MozyEnterprise partner:
      | period | users | server plan | net terms |
      | 12     | 8     | 100 GB      | yes       |
    Then New partner should be created
    When I get the partner_id
    And I act as newly created partner account
    And I add some new users and activate one machine for each
      | name           | user_group           | storage_type | storage_limit | devices | machine_name |
      | TC.16266.User1 | (default user group) | Desktop      | 50            | 3       | TestMachine1 |

      | TC.16266.User3 | (default user group) | Desktop      | 50            | 1       | TestMachine3 |
    And I navigate to the machine mapping page
    When I click the export machine csv button
    Then There should be export message to inform that it is exporting
    And The exported csv file should be like:(header as below, row number is 3, order by current owner, no duplicated rows)
      | column 1     | column 2      | column 3             | column 4  |

      | TestMachine3 | @machine_hash | <%=@users[2].email%> |           |
    Then I stop masquerading
    And I search and delete partner account by newly created partner company name
