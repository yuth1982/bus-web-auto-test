  Scenario: Change Partner
    When I act as partner by:
      | name          |
      | Belgacom Root |
    When I add a new user:
      | desktop licenses | desktop quota |
      | 0                | 0             |
    And I search user by:
      | keywords    | user type           |
      | @user_email | Belgacom Root Users |
    And I view user details by @user_email
    And I reassign the user to partner Enterprise Customer
    Then the user's partner should be Enterprise Customer
    Then I delete user
