    And I select event history
    Then this restore is In Progress
    When I log in bus admin console as administrator
    And I search user by:
      | keywords    |
      | @user_email |
    And I view user details by newly created user email
    Then I refund the user with all amount
    Then I check the refund amount should be correct
    And I search and delete partner account by newly created partner company name
