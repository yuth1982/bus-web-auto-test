    Then I act as newly created partner
    Given I get the partners name sub_partner_133209_level1_partner2 and type MozyPro
    When I act as MozyPro and create multiple users with 1 device on each user by selecting nil on partner filter:
      | name                | user_group           | storage_type | storage_limit | devices | enable_stash |
      | 133209_level1_user3 | (default user group) | Desktop      | 1             | 1       | Yes          |
    And I navigate to Search / List Machines section from bus admin console page
    And I view machine details for 133209_level1_user3_machine_1
    And I click on the replace machine link
    And Error message for replace machine should be Error: There are no eligible source machines to choose from.
