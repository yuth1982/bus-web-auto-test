# If you want to run these testcases in other environment other than QA5, You need to prepare these data
# To do: I will add a new feature to prepare these data automately
# AD server is needed in the environment
# (1). Add some partners with the following partner name and admin if not exist
# | partner name                      | admin                                    | usage                               |
# | Never Synced Test                 | user_sync_never_synced@auto.com          | the partner never synced            |
# | User Sync Automation              | user_sync_automation@auto.com            | general, mainly for the ui          |
# | Fed ID Partner                    | dvg@dvg.dvg                      | users in this partner can login     |
# | Machine Migration for TC16273     | user_sync_add_delete@auto.com            | add/delete users in the AD          |
# | Partner that has subpartner       | usrsync@test.com                         | scheduled sync                      |
# (2). add 3 groups to each partner: dev, qa, pm
# (3). add 9 users to AD server:
# dev_test1/dev_test1@test.com, dev_test2, dev_test3,
# qa_test1/qa_test1@test.com, qa_test2, qa_test3
# pm_test1/pm_test1@test.com, pm_test2, pm_test3
# (4). Update the following files: db_helper.rb, ldap_helper.rb
# configure the db, ldap to match the specified environment

Feature: User sync

  As an Mozy administrator
  I want to sync users from AD
  So that the partner admin can manage their users easily

  Background:
    Given I log in bus admin console as administrator
