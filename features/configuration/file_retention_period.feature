Feature: Configurable Retention Partner Setting (111550)

  As a Mozy SE, I want to restrict my customer's retention period to something less than what Mozy offers for my given
  plan, so they can manage their e-discovery exposure.

#  Success Criteria:
#  * Add a partner level parameter for all partners except Home.

#  * Paramater is adjustable down to 1 day and up to their products natural limit. Adjustments are made in 1 day
#  increments.

#  * Mozy Mac and Win client will honor the setting and mask any files outside the retention period

#  * Web and mobile client will honor the setting and mask any files outside of the retention period

#  Risks
#  * Partner settings, Client Controller (get_config)

  Background:
    Given I log in bus admin console as administrator
